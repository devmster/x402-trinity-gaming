/**
 * File-backed durable budget store. OPTIONAL - not part of the core, so it does not
 * count against the wrapper's footprint. Import it only if you want one.
 *
 * Needs no Cloudflare, no database, no network. Works anywhere Node/Bun/Deno runs:
 * your laptop, a VPS, a Raspberry Pi, a robotics controller.
 *
 *     import { createX402Fetch } from './x402.ts';
 *     import { createFileBudgetStore } from './budget-file.ts';
 *
 *     const x402Fetch = createX402Fetch({
 *       privateKey: process.env.X402_PRIVATE_KEY,
 *       policy: { maxAmountPerRequest: '5000', totalBudget: '1000000', allowNetworks: ['base'] },
 *       budgetStore: createFileBudgetStore('./.x402-budget.json'),
 *     });
 *
 * The spend total survives process restarts, which is the entire point: an in-memory
 * budget resets every time the process starts, so on mainnet it caps nothing.
 *
 * Concurrency: uses an exclusive lock file (O_EXCL), so multiple processes on the same
 * machine cannot both pass the same check. It does NOT coordinate across machines - for
 * that, back the same interface with Redis/Postgres/Workers KV instead.
